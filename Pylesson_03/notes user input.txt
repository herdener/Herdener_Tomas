More identifiers

We know how to give proper names or "identifiers" in our programs, and that these 
identifiersshould be both UNIQUE and DESCRIPTIVE.
there are many “best practice” rules we can follow to make our code readable.
Example, Identifiers that have 2 or more words can be difficult to read. Since we cant use 
spaces, starting new words in our identifiers with capital letters helps distinguish the 
two words. 



Built-in functions

functions in Phyton define the actions that a program will be capable of.to instruct the
program to actions, you need to cal the function by a name.We do this by entering the name
of the function, followed by a set of parentheses ().Example:
                                          
                                        functionName()

we are telling Python to run the function called “functionName()”. This function is called
“call”. By default, Python has a number of “built-in” functions that we will utilize through 
this course. By far the most useful is the input() function.
